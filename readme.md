# ad(a)vent of Code

In December of 2023, [adabay](https://adabay.rocks) incentivised it's developer team to participate in advent of code as part of a internal competition. I decided to create [Valhalla Script](https://github.com/IamSebastianDev/mjolnir) for this, to make it more challenging. You can find the individual day entries in the `entries` directory.

## Running locally

Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run `yarn mjolnir --file=./entries/<day>/day-<day>.vh` to compile and run the specified day.
